00130000
00140000The PROCSCAN program provides two utility services:
00150000
00160000  1) Scanning of a OS Cataloged Procedure (PROC) for compliance to the
00170000     Intel JCL Policy (IPP 184642) and selected parts of the Intel
00180000     Business System Production Naming Conventions Policy (IPP 184652).
00190000
00200000  2) Reformatting of a PROC to adhere to column alignment and relative
00210000     ordering of JCL keywords as specified by the JCL Policy
00220000     (IPP 18642).
00230000
00240000The program is invoked via the PROCSCAN PROC in 'INTEL.PROCLIB'.
00250000
00260000Please note that PROCSCAN is NOT A JCL SYNTAX CHECKER.  It assumes that
00270000it is scanning JCL that has PASSED a TYPRUN=SCAN without error.  It may
00280000get very confused if you have a JCL ERROR in the PROC it is scanning.
00290000
00300000Examples of use:
00310000
00320000   //DOIT   EXEC  PROCSCAN,LIB='INTRO.PROCLIB',
00330000   //             OPT='FULLPDS,MASK(ARS),REFORM'
00340000   //SYSUT2  DD   DSN=my.pds.name,DISP=SHR
00350000
00360000   would request reading of all members of INTRO.PROCLIB that start
00370000   with the characters 'ARS' in the member name and REFORMat them to
00380000   comply with the IPPs.  Place the reformatted members into
00390000   'my.pds.name'.
00400000
00410000   //DOIT2  EXEC  PROCSCAN,LIB='INTRO.PROCLIB',
00420000   //             OPT='FULLPDS,MASK(ARS),NOTRIVIA'
00430000
00440000   would request reading of all members of INTRO.PROCLIB that start
00450000   with the characters 'ARS' and suppress all 'trivial' (column and
00460000   comment) related messages (just the "real stuff" please..).
00470000
00480000   //DOIT3  EXEC  PROCSCAN,LIB='PROD.NTL.PROCLIB'
00490000   //SYSUT2  dd   DSN=CMS.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR
00500000   //SYSIN   DD   *
00510000   ARSP010 NOTRIVIA
00520000   CMSP150 TRIVIA,REFORM,NEWNAME(CMSP150A)
00530000   /*
00540000
00550000   would SCAN member ARSP010 in PROD.NTL.PROCLIB with NOTRIVIA
00560000   messages.  Would SCAN member CMSP150 and reformat it into
00570000   CMS.PROCLIB with the new member name of 'CMSP150A'.
00580000
00590000-----------------------------------------------------------------------
00600000The following keywords are acceptable in the PARM field, or in the OPT=
00610000field of the PROCSCAN cataloged procedure:
00620000
00630000  NOABEND            - supress ABEND on fatal errors; default=ABEND
00640000
00650000  FULLPDS            - process all members in the SYSLIB PDS that
00660000                       are have member names matching the MASK keyword.
00670000
00680000  MASK(member-mask)  - used to limit the processing while in FULLPDS
00690000                       mode.  The <member-mask> is a 1 to 8 character
00700000                       string.  The '*' is used as a 'wild-card' match
00710000                       character.  The default is MASK(********), which
00720000                       will accept any member name during FULLPDS
00730000                       processing.
00740000                       (e.g. use PARM='FULLPDS,MASK(ARS)' to process
00750000                        only ARS procs.)
00760000
00770000  INTRO              - allows use of 'INTRO.PARMLIB' and other 'INTRO.'
00780000                       datasets within the JCL of the PROC.  Without
00790000                       this keyword, all INTRO. datasets found will be
00800000                       flagged as illegal datasets. Default=NOINTRO
00810000

00860000                       (equivalent to 'NOCOLS,NOCOMM')

00880000  REFORM             - Requests that the PROC be reformatted to more
00890000                       closely comply with the JCL Policy.  Requires
00900000                       that the //SYSUT2 DD card point to a valid
00910000                       PDS to receive the reformatted PROC.
00920000
00930000  SEV(nn)            - Sets the severity level (see messages below) for
00940000                       a member above which the REFORM process will be
00950000                       suppressed. Default SEV(4).

01030000
01040000  INCR(nnnnn)        - Sets the increment for line numbers to be used
01050000                       in col 73-80 in the reformatted PROC.
01060000                       Default=INCR(10000).
01070000
01080000----------------------------------------------------------------------
01090000The following keywords may be used to request services for each member
01100000specified via the SYSIN control cards.  The control card format is:
01110000
01120000  member  options

00060000Two other installations have been 'caught' playing with the
00070000TSO QUEUE command and some significant enhancements were
00080000done.  We have taken the best of the two versions and
00090000combined them with our own modifications to produce a QUEUE
00100000with new features to help you process SYSOUT datasets.
00110000
00120000The following is a summary of the major changes to the QUEUE command:
00130000
00140000
00150000  QUEUE NOW SUPPORTS
00160000  THE FOLLOWING TERMINALS:
00170000
00180000      3278-2 -3 -4 -5
00190000      3279-2A/2B
00200000      3279-3A/3B
00210000
00220000     WARNING: terminal errors WILL occur if you
00230000     specify a terminal with a model number greater than the
00240000     actual model number of the terminal you are using.
00250000     Also, VTAM must be able to support your terminal via
00260000     tables changes.  If in TSO, you can execute the TERMINAL
00270000     SCR(lll,ccc) command and successfully change your
00280000     terminal size, you can use the new MODEL command to
00290000     reformat your display within QUEUE.
00300000
00310000  ADDITIONAL DISPLAY SUPPORT PROVIDED:
00320000
00330000
00340000    -  Support for 24 PFK operation was bagged from CBT-FILE 308
00350000       and is based on mods by Lane Bryant company.
00360000
00370000  PRINT SCREEN SUPPORT MODIFIED -
00380000
00390000    - Print 2 screens per paper page for -2 (24X80) AND -5 (27X132)
00400000    - print 1 screen  per paper page for -3 (32X80) AND -4 (43X80)
00410000
00420000  COMMAND ENHANCEMENTS:
00430000
00440000    -MO-   The MODEL command allows you to change your screen size
00450000           to support longer/wider screens. (see WARNING above.)
00460000
00470000    -ST-   Status command now accepts a JOBMASK instead of just a
00480000           JOBNAME.  The mask is composed of a partial JOBNAME
00490000           with '.', '*', or '?' characters used as "don't care"
00500000           characters.  (e.g.'ST AB?DE.F'  would find all jobs that
00510000           have 'AB' as the first 2 chars of the jobname, 'DE' as
00520000           the 4-5 chars, and 'F' in the 7th char. Anything in chars.
00530000           3, 6 or 8 will match).
00540000
00550000   -DO,AO,DI,AI,HI-  now support 'inquiry' processing via new operands
00560000           Q=    for queue class
00570000           L>    for number of lines
00580000           F=    for forms code
00590000           C=    for FCB code
00600000           T=    for UCS code
00610000
00620000           See the help for QUEUE or type DI X while in queue to see
00630000           the possible syntax and operands.
00640000
00650000   -DD,JCL,JOBLOG,JMSG,LIST- have been modified to allow you to use
00660000           the character '*' instead of the jobname/jobnumber to
00670000           indicate you mean the 'current' job.  Before you can use
00680000           the '*' you must select a job by using jobname or jobnumber.
00690000           (e.g.:
00700000                 JL $STR0D7
00710000                 DD *
00720000                 L * 118
00730000
00740000   -JCL-   The JCL command now has 2 optional operands after the
00750000           JOBID.
00760000
00770000           JC * R    will fetch the 'RAW' JCL (un-interpreted)
00780000           JC * I    will fetch the internal text for the job.
00790000
00800000   -DD-    The Display Datasets command has been modified to
00810000           show STEPNAME and PROCSTEP name (when available).
00820000
00830000      The display output for the ST,DJ,DI,DO,AO,HO,HI commands has
00840000      been changed to give more information :
00850000
00860000      The new format is:

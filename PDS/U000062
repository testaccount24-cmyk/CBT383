00090002The PROCXREF utility will read a PDS containing OS/JCL Cataloged
00100002Procedures (PROCs), perform symbolic substitution, and produce three
00110002reports:
00120002
00130002  1) A cross reference listing by DATASET NAME, which shows where
00140002     datasets are created, used and deleted.
00150002
00160002  2) A cross reference listing by SYSOUT CLASS/FORM which shows the
00170002     PROC/STEP/PGM/DDNAME using the CLASS/FORM.
00180002
00190002  3) A cross reference listing by PROGRAM NAME, which shows in which
00200002     PROC/STEP a program is executed.
00210002
00220002The DSN CROSS REFERENCE has the following fields on the report:
00230002
00240002  DSNAME - the OS Dataset name
00250002  GEN    - for GDG datasets, the relative generation number
00260002  DISP   - the DISP= parms on the DD card
00270002           note: Omitted parms on the DD card will have the normal
00280002                 OS/JCL defaults ASSUMED by PROCXREF
00290002  PROC   - the PROC member name referencing the dataset
00300002  STEP   - the STEP NAME within the PROC
00310002  PROGRAM- the PGM= parm on the EXEC card for the STEP listed
00320002  DDNAME - the DDNAME for the dataset (if blank, then it's a concat. ds)
00330002  UNIT   - the UNIT= parm on the DD card
00340002  FMT    - the RECFM= parm in the DCB
00350002  LRECL  - the LRECL= parm in the DCB
00360002  BLKSZ  - the BLKSIZE= parm in the DCB
00370002  SPACE/EXPDT - for DISK datasets, the SPACE= parm on the DD card
00380002                for TAPE datasets, the EXPDT= or RETPD= parm
00390002
00400002The DSN report is sorted by DSNAME, PROC, and STEP within proc.
00410002
00420002The SYSOUT Cross reference report has the following fields:
00430002
00440002  SYSOUT CLASS - the SYSOUT= parm on the DD card
00450002                 a single character (A-Z, 0-9, $ or *) indicates a
00460002                 SYSOUT class with the system default forms.
00470002                 a 'c,,form' format indicates sysout class of 'c'
00480002                 with a form type of 'form'
00490002
00500002  PROC   - the PROC member name which references the SYSOUT class
00510002  STEP   - the STEPNAME within the PROC where the SYSOUT class is
00520002           used.
00530002  PROGRAM- the PGM= parm on the EXEC card.
00540002  DDNAME - the DDNAME on the SYSOUT= DD card.
00550002
00560002The SYSOUT report is sorted by SYSOUT CLASS/FORM, PROC, STEP and is
00570002presented in the order of occurance of the DD cards.
00580002
00590002
00600002
00610002The PROGRAM CROSS REFERENCE has the following fields:
00620002
00630002  PROGRAM- the PGM= parm on the EXEC card
00640002  PROC   - the member name (PROC NAME) which executes the program
00650002  STEP   - the STEPNAME within the PROC where the PROGRAM is
00660002           executed.
00670002
00680002The PROGRAM report is sorted by PROGRAM, PROC and STEP.
00690002
00700002EXECUTION JCL:
00710002
00720002To run PROCXREF, use the following EXEC card:
00730002
00740002  //step010 EXEC PROCXREF,PROCLIB='dsname',
00750002  //             MEMBERS='sss'
00760002
00770002Where:
00780002
00790002   PROCLIB=  is the OS PDS PROCLIB dataset like 'PROD.NTL.PROCLIB',
00800002             'TEST.NTL.PROCLIB', 'INTRO.PROCLIB' (etc.)
00810002
00820002   MEMBERS=  is an optional parm used to specify which members are to
00830002             be selected. An asterisk (*) can be used as a 'wild-card'
00840002             match character in one or more positions.  For example:
00850002             MEMBERS='**S' will select any members with an 'S' in char
00860002             number 3.
00870002
00880002             To get all the procs for your project, use MEMBERS=sss
00890002             where 'sss' is your system acronym (e.g. STR, ARS, GLS etc)
00900002
00910002             If the MEMBERS parm is omitted, the ALL members in the
00920002             library are scanned.
00930002
00940002This program was obtained from the SHARE MVS MODS tape and modified
00950002for use at INTEL.  Enjoy...

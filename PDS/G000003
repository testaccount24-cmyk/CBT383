00400000The primary way to use TECHINFO is via the 'KWS' (Key Word Search)
00410000command.  This allows you to search for information on a particular
00420000subject.  For example, you might want to search information on
00430000programming AIDS.
00440000
00450000   type the command 'KWS  AIDS'
00460000
00470000which will show an index of all all items indexed with AIDS.
00480000
00490000You can select the item by item number (=2 etc.) or sequentially browse
00500000the entries.
00510000
00520002Please note that changes to members are designated by a '|' in col 80->|
00530002like the one on the line above.  The statistics on the 2 lines
00540002just above the $EOM line at the end indicate the SPF statistics
00550002on the member used to create the entry. The 'VER', is the SPF version
00560002level of the member. CREATE and MODIFIED are self-explanatory.
00570002The MODIFIED BY is the TSO USERID of the last person to modify the
00580002entry.  The L=, I=, and M= are the number of Current lines, Initial
00590002number of lines, and Modified number of lines as determined by
00600002SPF.

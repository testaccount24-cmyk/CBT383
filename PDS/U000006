00100000The UCC-1 Tape Management System provides controls, reporting
00110000capabilities, and facilities to manage tape resources while providing
00120002absolute tape data set protection.  Available to the Tape Librarian
00130002are batch and online capabilities for reporting and updating.  Real
00140002time tape processing insures that validity checking for scratch status
00150002is performed before a problem program is allowed access--update of the
00160000Tape Management Catalog is immediate at OPEN/CLOSE/EOV time.  Control
00170000of the scratch pool by TMS is a two-stage process, minimizing the
00180000possibility of human error.  A Vault Management System is provided in
00190000TMS for off-site control.  Backup and recovery procedures involve not
00200000only the TMC but also an Audit data set, both of which are copied to
00210000tape at a synchronized point.
00220000
00230002The Tape Management System allows JCL control of tapes via the EXPDT
00240002or RETPD parameter of the DD statement or assumption of a Default
00250000Retention Period.  The EXPDT parameter may contain normal Julian dates
00260000or special UCC ONE defined keywords.  These keywords indicate special
00270000hold criteria:  cycle control, catalog control, permanent hold, or
00280002frequency control.  Cycle control holds a specified number of cycles
00290002of a tape data set.  Catalog control holds a tape as long as it is on
00300002the OS catalog.  Permanent control hold protects a tape indefinitely.
00310000Frequency control protects a tape as long as it is used every n days
00320000where n is user defined for an individual data set.

00350000
00360002Tapes not controlled by UCC ONE can be processed by specifing this
00370002keyword in the DD card that controls the tape.  EXPDT=98000 for input
00380000tape indicates the tape is from an external source with a reel number
00390000duplicate to a UCC ONE controlled volume serial number.  UCC ONE
00400000processing is bypassed for these tapes and an exception record is
00410000written to the Audit Data Set.  For output, all non UCC ONE controlled
00420000tape must have EXPDT=98000.  Also, the operator must verify (via
00430000console) an output tape is from an external source if there is a
00440000matching VSN under UCC ONE.
00450000
00460000 EXPDT=98ddd
00470000
00480000This keyword is used to indicate data set retention will expire ddd
00490000days after the last time the data set is used.  The value for ddd must
00500000be greater than 0 and less than 366.  This type expiration date is
00510000useful for returning tapes to the scratch pool which cannot be assigned
00520000a definitive expiration date.  Programmer testing is an example of a
00530000need for this type expiration date.  Each time the tape is used, the
00540000expiration date is extended the number of days specified in the JCL
00550000when the tape was created.  When the tape is not used in ddd days, the
00560000file expires and will be made available for scratch.
00570000
00580000 EXPDT=99000
00590000
00600000This keyword is used to specify a data set is eligible for scratch when
00610000it becoms uncataloged from the system catalog.  As long as the tape is
00620000cataloged on the system catalog it is protected from being scratched.
00630000this is the Default Retention Period.
00640000
00650000 EXPDT=99365
00660000
00670000This keyword specifies the tape data set is permanently protected by
00680000UCC ONE.  Manual update by the Tape Librarian is required to scratch
00690000tapes created with this keyword.
00700000
00710000   Permanently held tapes cannot be recreated, howvever, DISP=MOD is
00720000   allowed.
00730000
00740000Many of the facilities of TMS are available only to the Tape Librarian.
00750000Questions regarding the status of individual tapes as well as specific
00760000choices of JCL LABEL information should be directed there until
00770000standards  on the subject are developed and published.
00780000
00790000Available as a CLIST is the TMSI inquiry, which accesses both the
00800000system catalog structure and the TMS Tape Management Catalog in
00810000providing location information.  Simply issue the command (under SPF
00820000panel six or normal TSO), remembering to prefix with a percent sign (a
00830000reserved character to SPF screens), then furnish either a six-digit
00840000volume serial number (direct search against the TMC) or a data set name
00850000(system catalog search with volser used as index).  To terminate the
00860000inquiry session, enter C .
